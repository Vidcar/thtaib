## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: API-010 - Present durable Chat state without duplicating or inventing work

Every displayed snapshot SHALL pair message text, run state and resume cursor from the same observation. Completion and token-log compaction MUST NOT remove a message while hydration or reconnect prepares it. A native finished message SHALL remain readable until its authoritative graph message arrives. The desktop MUST advance its resume cursor only after a complete event frame has arrived; disconnecting inside a frame MUST replay that frame.

Existing Chat SHALL support new, rename, archive, retained-title/message search and reopen. Archive changes visibility, not memory/context. Incremental answers, separate returned reasoning, tool content and partial failures SHALL reconcile by run/thread/message/call identity into one final saved result. Internal summaries MUST NOT appear as answers. After the verified `migrate-local-agent-interaction` prerequisite, consume the supported `@langchain/react` interaction boundary for message/tool/state projections and scoped subscriptions; do not extend the superseded custom `snapshot` / `run_event` / `stream_end` contract. Application-owned durable history, run identity, reconnect/hydration and authorization remain authoritative; reconcile SDK updates into one saved result and avoid rewriting the entire growing run for every token.

Submitted user text SHALL display literally with original backslashes, punctuation, line breaks and indentation preserved, while long text wraps within the bubble. Model-only context additions MUST NOT appear as user-authored text. Assistant replies SHALL retain safe Markdown, code and table rendering.

Expose effective setup, actual selected tools/results, observed planning, context capacity/usage/compaction, approvals and loading/empty/error/reconnect states. Provide safe Markdown/code/table rendering, copy and access-checked open/save actions, keyboard controls and scrolling that respects the user's position. Generated HTML/scripts MUST NOT execute in the trusted renderer; opening/saving is not execution authority.

The `repair-local-interaction-boundaries` prerequisite SHALL remain satisfied: selection and transport binding stay atomic, stale callbacks are generation-guarded, command configuration and draft ownership are isolated, and accepted work is never retargeted or repeated by navigation. External links SHALL retain main-owned HTTP(S) validation and requesting-document/frame authorization; neither untrusted windows nor replacement documents gain the backend token.

#### Scenario: Reconnect and terminal result

- **WHEN** a streamed turn reconnects or completes while the user switches conversations
- **THEN** snapshots/events and final hydration produce one correctly attributed saved answer with partial/tool content intact.

#### Scenario: History and rendering

- **WHEN** history is archived or generated code/HTML is displayed
- **THEN** archive does not erase execution context and content cannot execute with desktop privileges.


#### Scenario: Exact submitted user text
- **WHEN** a person submits a Windows path, backticks, Markdown punctuation, blank lines or indented text
- **THEN** the user bubble SHALL retain those characters and spacing literally without interpreting them as Markdown or HTML
- **AND** assistant Markdown and code remain formatted, attachments remain accessible, and model-only context notices remain outside the user bubble.


### Requirement: API-017 - Expose compact effective model controls and measurements

Opening a conversation SHALL restore that conversation's explicit Ask or Full access choice. An application preference SHALL seed new conversations and SHALL default to Ask on a fresh installation; project and agent definitions SHALL NOT override access. A chat's explicit choice SHALL survive unrelated preference changes and MUST NOT leak from the previously viewed chat. Access labels SHALL show Ask or Full access in full and explain that running and already queued messages keep their selected policy. Descriptions and model instructions SHALL reflect saved permission grants and the actual selected mode, while explicit questions and disabled-tool boundaries remain enforced.

The conversation SHALL visibly expose separate main-model and main-agent selectors beside the composer, supported reasoning effort or Thinking off, a removable Plan pill, compact attachments, capability groups and access. One model picker row SHALL represent one installed model; its named configurations SHALL be secondary choices. Changing an agent SHALL NOT silently change the main model. The shield selects Ask or Full access for later messages in that chat and does not turn tools on or off. The `+` menu SHALL expose optional capability groups and attachments without a list of individual tool toggles; project files remain available in project chats, while shell, browser and Windows control require explicit conversation choices. The setup rail SHALL start closed and MUST NOT take height from the transcript while closed. Changes SHALL affect future submissions without rewriting active turns or queued intended configuration. Unsupported, overridden or unverified reasoning controls SHALL be labelled truthfully; hiding returned thinking MUST NOT be represented as disabling model reasoning.

Compact status elements SHALL expose current context fill and generation speed in tok/s, with capacity, counting/measurement basis and relevant interval available on expansion. Observed measurements, labelled estimates and unavailable values SHALL remain distinguishable. Stream chunks MUST NOT be counted as tokens; absent usage MUST NOT appear as zero. Context changes/compaction and current versus completed-turn measurements SHALL remain attributable rather than silently showing stale values as current.

Context details SHALL open on pointer hover and keyboard focus, with touch access and Escape dismissal. Prefer model-reported request input/output counts over preflight estimates once available. Supported llama.cpp timing streams SHALL supply live generation speed with bounded updates and no shared-slot polling; measurements SHALL reset at each model-call boundary and retain their current/completed/interrupted status. Compact settings SHALL avoid redundant default-value cards while preserving actionable failures, meaningful choices and accessible explanations.

Opening the application or restoring a chat SHALL NOT warm its selected model. Sending with an unloaded installed managed model SHALL load the selected setup through the existing manager and admission path, show waiting/loading/readiness, then submit once ready. Failure SHALL preserve input and offer recovery. A passive status probe MUST NOT cause loading. Active-work protections and connected-endpoint ownership MUST NOT be bypassed and models/settings MUST NOT be silently substituted.

#### Scenario: Unsupported reasoning and unavailable telemetry
- **WHEN** the selected model lacks a supported thinking-off control or supplies no usable token measurement
- **THEN** the control/measurement explicitly reflects that limitation rather than claiming thinking is off or showing an invented tok/s value.

#### Scenario: Cold launch and first Send
- **WHEN** Workbench opens a chat whose selected model is unloaded, then the person submits a draft
- **THEN** launch remains cold, Send shows loading and submits once that exact configuration is ready, while failure preserves the draft and cannot duplicate accepted work.

#### Scenario: Start from Chat with a resource conflict or failure
- **WHEN** a submitted draft needs an unloaded model while another request holds the only slot or loading fails
- **THEN** Chat shows waiting or the failure with a corrective action, preserves the draft and cannot duplicate accepted work.

#### Scenario: Setup stays off the transcript
- **WHEN** a person opens the conversation rail to Setup
- **THEN** setup sits in that rail and the transcript remains readable beside or above it.

#### Scenario: Inherited access follows its named source
- **WHEN** the application preference changes after a chat explicitly selected Ask
- **THEN** that chat remains Ask while a new chat takes the current application preference, and Chat names the preference source when no explicit choice exists.

#### Scenario: Bounded everyday reasoning and scoped measurements
- **WHEN** the user selects Balanced or Deep and later an internal summary runs
- **THEN** Chat SHALL show the effective supported thinking/response limits and distinguish work, summary, cached input, current measurements and completed measurements without inventing unavailable values.

### Requirement: API-019 - Present queued work and scoped attention clearly

During active work Enter queues the draft. The send control stays the send arrow, with a separate Stop control. A compact row inside the composer SHALL expose each queued message with edit and remove. Stop SHALL cancel the active turn separately; cancelling leaves the queue paused until deliberate continuation. A queued message sends itself when the turn finishes successfully. AGT-010 SHALL govern persistence, dispatch and progression: only success advances automatically, failure/cancellation pauses, and approval/input waits do not advance. Header setting changes MUST NOT silently mutate queued items.

Inline approval cards SHALL show exact action/resource scope and the four AGT-008 choices, explaining broader grant scope before selection. Saved grants SHALL remain inspectable/revocable in Settings. Sidebar badges and a compact attention list SHALL identify conversations waiting for approval/input or needing failure recovery. The count is the same small circle on the bell in the expanded and collapsed navigation. A notice can be dismissed. Opening a notice selects its existing conversation and dismisses that notice. If that conversation is gone, the notice is dismissed and a new chat is not created. Deleting a conversation dismisses notices for runs that leave with it, and the bell count updates immediately. A dismissed notice does not return. The list finds the conversation that contains the run, including when that run is no longer the latest turn. Windows notifications SHALL default on for those events while the application is backgrounded, subject to OS/user settings; successful completion notifications SHALL default off. Notifications MUST NOT steal focus, auto-switch conversation or answer interruptions. User activation SHALL navigate to the corresponding current conversation/attention state without replaying work; in-app attention SHALL remain usable when OS notifications are unavailable.

#### Scenario: Queue with independent configuration

- **WHEN** a user queues a follow-up, changes the selected model and then the active turn fails
- **THEN** the queue pauses with its original intended model/setup visible and editable, and Stop/Queue remain distinct from approval actions.

#### Scenario: Background approval and notification navigation

- **WHEN** another conversation requests approval while the app is backgrounded
- **THEN** its badge/attention entry and allowed Windows notification identify it without moving focus, and opening it presents the current interruption rather than accepting a stale decision.

Project waiting SHALL be distinct from a follow-up behind the same conversation. A known settled outcome in one chat SHALL permit another eligible chat in that project to advance after revalidation; failed-conversation follow-ups keep their existing pause rule. The waiting row SHALL name its owner and offer Open active chat and Cancel waiting message.

#### Scenario: Another chat owns the project
- **WHEN** a submitted message waits for an overlapping project task
- **THEN** the message SHALL show that project wait rather than model loading and its cancellation SHALL affect only itself.

### Requirement: API-026 - Show planning and native tool activity as it happens

While an assistant turn runs, and when that turn is reopened, Chat SHALL show planning and tool activity from the projected tool calls. This is visible with detailed streams on or off.

`write_todos` SHALL appear as one checklist for that turn. Each item shows its task content and its status: pending, in progress, or completed. The status is a mark on that row, separate from the sentence. The sentence is the task content alone. The checklist is the arguments of the latest successful `write_todos` call. A later successful call replaces the list. A failed call leaves the previous list and shows the failure. The product MUST NOT keep a second todo list or read private graph state. Raw arguments remain available on a further disclosure. The checklist appears only once those arguments parse as the todo list.

Each other filesystem, search, shell, MCP, and memory tool keeps one identity line, one per call identity, in order, without a duplicate when live and retained records join:

- Reading or Read, plus the path. When the call includes an offset and limit, the line includes that line range.
- Creating or Created, Editing or Edited, using the recorded operation.
- Listing or Listed, Finding or Found files matching, Searching or Searched for, Running or Ran, Calling or Called, Proposing or Proposed a memory.

An actively running unfinished call uses the present-tense verb. The finished call uses the past tense. A failure shows on that line. Retained incomplete arguments from a stopped or failed turn SHALL be labelled as partial input, never as ongoing work or a completed file. Starting a later turn MUST NOT reactivate that label. Tool activity MUST NOT claim a file difference or line count that was not recorded. A shell line shows the command truncated to one line.

A single finished call stays as that identity line. Two or more consecutive finished successful calls that share the same verb, and that are not waiting for a person, collapse into one summary line. The summary names the verb and how many calls it covers, for example "Read 6 files" or "Ran 3 commands". It does not invent a combined file result. Opening the summary shows the identity lines in their original order. A call that is still running, a call that failed, and a call that is waiting for approval or a typed answer each stay on their own line and are not folded into a summary. Closing the summary does not discard the calls.

The first opening of an identity line shows the plain result: the path, the command, the output, or the short description of the change. The internal tool name and the raw arguments stay on a further disclosure. They MUST NOT be the first thing that opening shows.

While a call is unfinished and its body is open, that body follows the newest line until the person scrolls inside it. The open body shows the full text produced so far. Every line stays reachable by scrolling, and copy copies that full text. The product MUST NOT drop earlier text to keep the view small. Completed file content SHALL remain readable with its original line breaks; raw arguments remain available separately.

Choosing a file identity line opens the Files page on that file when available. Choosing a summary line does not open the dock. The choice MUST NOT send a chat message or call the model. Approvals and typed questions keep their existing cards. The activity line MUST NOT offer a second set of approval buttons.

#### Scenario: Todo list updates in place

- **WHEN** the agent writes a todo list and later marks an item complete
- **THEN** one checklist shows the latest successful items and statuses
- **AND** detailed streams being off does not hide it.

#### Scenario: Checklist status stays off the sentence

- **WHEN** a checklist item is pending and its content is "Fix the frame step"
- **THEN** the row shows that content as the sentence and shows pending as a separate mark
- **AND** the sentence does not begin with the word pending.

#### Scenario: Native file edit line

- **WHEN** an edit of `thistest.md` finishes
- **THEN** the transcript shows one line equivalent to "Edited thistest.md"
- **AND** choosing it opens the live file when available, without claiming an undoable difference.

#### Scenario: Read activity

- **WHEN** the agent reads `SKILL.md`
- **THEN** the transcript shows a line equivalent to "Read SKILL.md"
- **AND** no invented change count is shown.

#### Scenario: Incomplete file call stays partial

- **WHEN** an edit has started and its result is not yet available
- **THEN** the line shows that the file is being edited
- **AND** only genuinely incomplete arguments are labelled as partial input; complete calls show undispatched, failed or uncertain outcome according to available evidence, without an invented result or line count.

#### Scenario: Failed todo does not wipe the list

- **WHEN** a todo update fails after a successful list
- **THEN** the previous checklist remains and the failure is visible.

#### Scenario: A long write stays fully readable

- **WHEN** a file write is still streaming, the person has the row open, and they then scroll toward the start of that body
- **THEN** the newest lines were in view while the body was following
- **AND** scrolling reaches the earlier lines and copy copies the full text written so far.

#### Scenario: A burst of reads is one line

- **WHEN** a turn finishes six successful reads in a row and none of them is waiting for a person
- **THEN** the transcript shows one summary equivalent to "Read 6 files"
- **AND** opening it shows the six paths in the order they ran.

#### Scenario: The live call stays visible

- **WHEN** five reads have finished and a sixth read is still running
- **THEN** the finished reads are one summary and the running read is its own line
- **AND** a failed read is not folded into the successful summary.

#### Scenario: Opening a tool shows the result first

- **WHEN** a person opens a finished shell line
- **THEN** the command and its output are the first content
- **AND** the internal tool name and the raw arguments stay behind a further disclosure.

The original durable parent-turn error SHALL remain visible after reopening, with its category and relevant recovery action. Review setup SHALL be offered only for setup problems. Known recoverable tool errors SHALL be returned to the agent for correction; uncertain effects SHALL be inspected before continuation.

#### Scenario: Parallel batch partially succeeds
- **WHEN** two file writes succeed and four fail
- **THEN** the two confirmed results SHALL remain successful and the four failures SHALL show their original causes
- **AND** the chat SHALL stay usable without relabelling all six calls as unfinished input.

### Requirement: API-033 - Use one title and a distinct model label

The sidebar row for a conversation and that conversation's header SHALL show the same current title. A new conversation may read "New conversation" until it has a title. When the title changes, both update together.

Each model chooser SHALL show one primary row per installed model or connected endpoint, with an installed model's named configurations as secondary choices, rather than duplicate historical runtime instances. Sibling model rows or configuration choices MUST NOT share the same visible label. A repeated file name gains the fact that distinguishes it, such as ready or stopped, context, or size. An internal prefix such as `managed:` MUST NOT appear in the label. Meaningfully distinct configurations SHALL remain selectable; equivalent duplicate runtime records SHALL not become duplicate user choices.

In the library, rows that share a file name stay separate, and each row shows when it was added and where it belongs without opening the file.

#### Scenario: The sidebar matches the header

- **WHEN** a conversation's title changes from "New conversation" to a sentence
- **THEN** the sidebar row and the header both show that sentence
- **AND** a second conversation that is still untitled stays "New conversation".

#### Scenario: Repeated model files stay distinguishable

- **WHEN** two selectable configurations of one installed model use the same file name and one is ready
- **THEN** both remain distinguishable as secondary choices under the single model row
- **AND** each choice has its own visible label without an internal prefix.
