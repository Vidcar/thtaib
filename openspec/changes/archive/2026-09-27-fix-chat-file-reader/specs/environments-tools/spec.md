# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: ENV-020 - Use native file tools without duplicate mutations

Ordinary Chat SHALL offer Deep Agents built-in `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, and `grep` when project file access is selected. `execute` SHALL be offered only when ENV-008 attaches the host shell, and `write_todos` only when planning is selected. The product MUST NOT register another implementation of those tools or custom rename/delete tools. The upstream recursive `delete` and general-purpose `task` MUST NOT be offered in ordinary Chat, including compiled children; named helpers retain their selected invocation path. Application tools that are not file mutations remain `ask_user`, `propose_memory`, `read_attachment`, `echo`, and `time_now`; MCP tools remain supplied by ENV-007.

Selecting project file reading SHALL retain that access when knowledge search is also enabled. The reader description SHALL match its effective access. A reader supplied only for saved tool results, conversation history or retrieved evidence MUST remain restricted to those supplied routes and MUST NOT authorize project or knowledge file access.

#### Scenario: No custom file deletion

- **WHEN** ordinary Chat presents project file tools
- **THEN** native read/write/edit/list/search are available as selected while custom rename/delete and recursive `delete` are absent.

#### Scenario: Concurrent same-file edits

- **WHEN** one assistant response requests simultaneous edits to the same path
- **THEN** the built-in guard rejects the conflict before two writes can race.

#### Scenario: No second reader

- **WHEN** the harness is assembled for a project
- **THEN** the file tools are Deep Agents built-ins and the application registers no second tool with their names.

#### Scenario: Parallel creation of a missing Windows directory
- **WHEN** native tools concurrently write distinct files under a new shared directory
- **THEN** equivalent Windows path representations SHALL not cause false escape errors, and each call SHALL retain its own success or error result
- **AND** genuine traversal, junction escape and same-file conflicts SHALL remain rejected.

#### Scenario: Native Unicode search on Windows

- **WHEN** Chat searches valid UTF-8 text containing Unicode characters or Unicode filenames through a project or framework file route on Windows
- **THEN** results SHALL preserve the exact matching text, paths, match limits and truncation status without a locale decoding failure
- **AND** the supported backend entrypoints and desktop shortcut SHALL provide the same behavior without changing host-command encoding or replacing the native tools.

#### Scenario: Project reads alongside knowledge search

- **WHEN** a project-bound Chat selects file reading and knowledge search
- **THEN** valid project files SHALL remain readable through returned virtual paths and project-relative filenames
- **AND** retrieved evidence, saved tool results and conversation history SHALL remain readable through their supplied routes.

#### Scenario: Result-only reader with project file access omitted

- **WHEN** Chat has active tools but has not selected file reading and receives an automatic reader for saved results or retrieved evidence
- **THEN** the reader SHALL permit only the supplied result routes and describe that restriction
- **AND** project and knowledge files, traversal and host-drive paths SHALL remain denied; tools-off SHALL execute no reader.
